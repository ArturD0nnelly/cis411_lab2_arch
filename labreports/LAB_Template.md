# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [x] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [x] I have reviewed the [lecture / discsussion](../assets/04p1_SolutionArchitectures.pdf) on architecture patterns.
- [x] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Analyze the Proposal
This application would help people to find more volunteer opportunities. The application would also organize the organization's information and event locations to make the experience of finding the volunteer position easier.
